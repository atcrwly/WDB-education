    <h3>Fictional Biography</h3>
    <h4>Novels</h4>
    <p>Geralt is a witcher. Shortly after being born, Geralt's mother, Visenna, gave him away to undergo training
         and, eventually, become a witcher at Kaer Morhen – the stronghold of the witchers. Geralt survived mutations 
         during the Trial of the Grasses, thanks to which he gained various witcher traits: high resistance to injury, 
         poison, and diseases, as well as slowed aging, but also infertility. He resisted the "changes" brought on by the 
         Trial of Grasses better than most, which encouraged his makers to perform even more dangerous experimental 
         procedures on him, making him lose all body pigmentation. Because of his pale skin and white hair, he is also 
         known in the Elder Speech as "Gwynbleidd" (close to the Welsh translation "Blaidd Gwyn"[4]), the White Wolf. 
         From the arduous training of Witchers, he became a master swordfighter and learnt how to use the Signs, simple spells 
         used by the witchers.
